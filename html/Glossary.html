			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>			
			<tr> 
				<td> <div id="a">Abstract</div></td>
				<td> A java keyword that is used in a class definition. An abstract class can not be instantiated but rather inherited. You cannot create an object from an abstract class, but you can extend an abstract class. </td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr> 
				<td>Access Modifier</td>
				<td>Reserved words "public", "private", "protected" in Java. Control whether classes and members may be accessed from any class, only this class, subclasses. The default is access from any class in the package. </td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr> 
				<td>API (Application Programming Interface)</td>
				<td>A collection of public methods for a class or package</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr> 
				<td>Argument</td>
				<td>A data item that is passed during a method call. Closely related to parameter, but different.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				<td><div id="b">Boolean</div> </td>
				<td>Refers to an expression or variable that can only have a true or false value</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				<td><div id="c">Casting</div> </td>
				<td>Explicit conversion of one data type to another. Essentially you're telling the compiler that an Object of type TyBeanieToy is more specific TyBeanieKid and therefore gaining access to all the methods on TyBeanieKid that you wouldn't have had.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				<td>Class</td>
				<td>Classes are the "blueprint" from which you create objects. A class contains fields and methods. </td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				<td>Constructor</td>
				<td>Special block of code used to create an instance of a class (or, if you prefer, an object whose type is the class). Used with the "new" keyword (e.g., TyBeanieKid reg = new TyBeanieKid() calls the TyBeanieKid() constructor). </td>
			 </tr>
				<td>Compiler</td>
				<td>A program to translate source code into code to be executed by a computer. Java compiler will translate source code into bytecode for the JVM.</td>
			 </tr>
			 </tr>
				<td><div id='e'>Exception</div></td>
				<td>A event during program execution that prevents the program from its' normal course; usually an error. Important keywords: try, catch, and throw. </td>
			 </tr>
			 </tr>
				<td><div id='e'>Exception Handler</div></td>
				<td>A block of code that reacts to a specific type of exception. If the exception is for an error that the program can recover from, the program can resume executing after the exception handler has executed.</td>
			 </tr>
				<td><div id='f'>Field</div></td>
				<td>A data member of a class. Usually marked private and accessed through getters and setters. </td>
			 </tr>
			 </tr>
				<td><div id='g'>Garbage Collection</div></td>
				<td>The java programming language has automatic detection and freeing of memory that is no longer used. The java runtime system handles garbage collection so programmers never explicitly free objects</td>
			 </tr>
			 </tr>
				<td><div id='h'>HTTP</div></td>
				<td>HyperText Transfer Protocol. The Internet protocol, based on the TCP/IP, used to fetch hypertext objects from remote hosts.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				<td>HTTPS</td>
				<td>HyperText Transfer Protocol layered over the SSL protocol</td>
			 <tr>
			 </tr>
				<td><div id='i'>implements</div></td>
				<td>Java keyword included in the class declaration to specify any interfaces by the current class. Unlike inheritance (class can only extend one class), a class can implement many interfaces. An interface is like a contract, a promise to include a bunch of empty no good methods.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				<td><div id="j">Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)</div> </td>
				<td>An industry standard for database-independent connectivity between the Java platform and a wide range of databases. The JDBC provides a call-level API for SQL-based database access</td>
			</tr>
			 <tr>
				<td>Java Development Kit (JDK)</td>
				<td>A software development environment for writing applets and applications in the Java programming language.</td>
			</tr>
			 <tr>
				<td>JRE (Java Runtime Environment)</td>
				<td>Consists of JVM and allows you to run java applets and applications.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>JVM (Java Virtual Machine) </td>
				<td>The program that runs Java programs on a specific platform. Java source code  is compiled into .class files(called Java bytecode). These contain the instructions used by the JVM to actually run the programs on a Windows PC, a Linux computer, a Mac computer, etc. The JVM is written for each platform supported by Java. Included in the JRE. Remember, "Write once, Run anywhere".</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>JavaScript </td>
				<td>JavaScript != Java. A web scripting language that is used in both browsers and Web servers. Like all scripting languages, it is used primarily to tie other components together or to accept user input.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>JUnit Test</td>
				<td>A set of Java classes used to test individual methods in a Java class</td>
			 <tr>
				<td><div id="k">Keyword </div></td>
				<td>Java sets asides words as keywords, meaning they are reserved by the Java programming language and cannot be used as variable names or method names. e.g.  abstract, boolean, continue, new, this, throw, while, super, etc.</td>
			</tr>			
			<tr>
				<td><div id="m">Method </div></td>
				<td>A set of code that can be called at any point by using the method's name. A method is a subprogram that acts on data and returns a value. There are built-in methods provided by Java, and methods that you create. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Multithreaded</td>
				<td>A program that is designed to have parts of its code run concurrently</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Object</td>
				<td>An instance of a class. We could have a TyBeanieKid class and a Reg would be an object created using the class. In other words, Reg is an object of type Ty Beanie Kid, or an instance of Ty Beanie Kid</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td>Object oriented design</td>
				<td>A software design methodology that models characteristics of abstract or real objects using classes and objects</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td>Overload (Method)</td>
				<td>To provide multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (i.e., same name but different signatures</td>
			</tr>
			 <tr>
				<td>Override (Method)</td>
				<td>When a subclass implements a method inherited from the super class, the method is said to be overriden.</td>
			</tr>		
			<tr>
				<td><div id="p">Parameter</div></td>
				<td>The definition of what data item(s) is to be passed during a method call. Closely related to argument, but different.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td>Primitive Types</td>
				<td>Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language; including boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float and double. These types are the building blocks of data manipulation in Java.</td>
			</tr>	
			 <tr>
				<td>protected</td>
				<td>Java keyword used in method or variable declaration. It indicates that the method or variable can only be accessed by elements in its class, subclasses, or classes in the same package.</td>
			</tr>
			 <tr>
				<td>public</td>
				<td>Java keyword used in method or variable declaration. It indicates that the method can be accessed by elements residing in other classes.</td>
			</tr>			
			<tr>
				<td><div id="r">Refactor</div></td>
				<td>To improve a program without changing the way it works. Examples include renaming fields or variables, streamlining code.</td>
			</tr>		
			 <tr>
				<td>Reference Variable</td>
				<td>In Java, variable that holds an object reference (e.g. reg = new TyBeanieKid();). Points to an area on the "heap" where the object resides. Contrast with value variable.</td>
			</tr>		
			<tr>
				<td><div id="s">Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</div></td>
				<td>A protocol that allows communication between a web browser and a server to be encrypted for privacy</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td>Serialization</td>
				<td>The encoding of objects, and the objects reachable from them, into a stream of bytes and the complementary reconstruction of the object graph from the stream.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td>static</td>
				<td>Java keyword used to define a variable as a class variable. Classes maintain one copy of class variables regardless of how many instances exist of that class. static can also be used to define a method as a class method. Class methods are invoked by the class instead of a specific instance, and can only operate on class variables</td>
			</tr>			
			<tr>
				<td>Static Field</td>
				<td>Equivalent to class variable (see static definition above)</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td>Static Method</td>
				<td>A method that belongs to the entire class instead of one instance of the class. Invoked with Class.Method (e.g., TyBeanieKid.getTotalKids();) (also known as class method)</td>
			</tr>		
			<tr>
				<td><div id="t">Thread</div></td>
				<td>The basic unit of execution. A process can have several threads running concurrently, each performing a different job, such as waiting for events or performing a time-consuming job that the program doesn't need to complete before going on. When a thread has finished its job, the thread is suspended or destroyed.</td>
			</tr>		
			<tr>
				<td><div id="v">Value Variable</div></td>
				<td>In Java, variable that holds the value of a Java primitive (e.g., integer, character, etc.) Held in the memory stack. Contrast with reference variable.</td>
			</tr>		
			 <tr>
				<td>Virtual Machine</td>
				<td>A virtual machine (VM) is a software implementation of a machine (like a computer) that executes programs like a physical machine. </td>
			</tr>		
			 <tr>
				<td><div id="w">Web Server </div></td>
				<td>Software that provides services to access the internet, an intranet, or an extranet. A Web server hosts Web sites, provides support for HTTP and other protocols, and executes server-side provides (such as CGI scripts or servlets) that perform certain functions</td>
